# Crop Leaf Disease Identification and Classification


This repository contains a project focused on crop leaf disease identification and classification using deep learning models. The goal is to accurately classify diseases in crop leaves based on images.

## Models Implemented:
- **VGG16**
- **VGG19**
- **MobileNet**
- **ResNet50**
- **InceptionV3**

Each model is trained and evaluated using the Plant Village dataset, consisting of images from multiple classes of crop diseases.

## Contents:
- **Notebook Files**: Jupyter notebooks for each model implementation and evaluation.
- **Trained Models**: Pre-trained model files (`*.h5`) for VGG16 and InceptionV3.
- **Dataset**: Sample images from the Plant Village dataset for demonstration.
- **Prediction on Unseen Data**: Jupyter notebook (`prediction_on_unseen_data.ipynb`) demonstrating how the trained models can be used to predict disease classes on unseen images.



Feel free to explore the notebooks and trained models to understand how each model was implemented and evaluated. The `prediction_on_unseen_data.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to use the trained models to classify diseases in unseen images.
